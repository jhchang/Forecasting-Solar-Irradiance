Solar irradiance is often integrated over a given time period in order to report the radiant energy emitted into the surrounding environment (joule per square metre, J/m2) during that time period. This integrated solar irradiance is called solar irradiation. So for this project we will use the terms irradiance and irradiation interchangably, but note that our time period is 1 hour."

        "- The Radiation Parameters seem to be 0 a large portion of the time. This makes sense since the sun is not shining on Al Shuaibah all of the time and therefore the amount of power from the sun in that area would be zero.\n",
        "- All Sky Surface Shortwave Diffuse Irradiance (DHI (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance)) seems to have a lot of outliers. This makes sense because it measures irradiance that does not come directly from the sun or has been scattered by particles or clouds in the atmosphere. This implies that there are rarely high levels of sandstorms or clouds.\n",

        "\n",
        "   * Use **robust scalers** (e.g., `RobustScaler` or `QuantileTransformer`) instead of `StandardScaler`.\n",
        "   * Train models that **handle non-Gaussian data** (e.g., tree-based models, not plain linear regression).\n",

        "4. **Mark unusual events**\n",

        "#### Key actions taken:\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🔍 **Replaced placeholder error values** (`-999`) across multiple features with either:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Domain-appropriate defaults (e.g., `0` for `ALLSKY_KT` and `ALLSKY_SRF_ALB` at night)\n",
        "  * Rolling averages from surrounding time steps (for features with unexpected anomalies)\n",
        "* 📉 **Dropped or interpolated missing values** where necessary to maintain time continuity\n",
        "* 📆 **Preserved the `DatetimeIndex`** for accurate time-based modeling and analysis\n",
        "* 🔧 **Filtered or capped outliers** only when physically unrealistic (e.g., values beyond known atmospheric limits)\n",
        "\n",
        "These preprocessing steps are critical for maintaining the **integrity of the dataset** and ensuring that the machine learning model:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Learns from **real-world weather patterns**, not from sensor noise\n",
        "* Handles **day-night transitions and irradiance drop-offs** gracefully\n",
        "* Is not biased or destabilized by extreme placeholder values\n",
        "\n",
        "This cleaned dataset now forms a solid foundation for **exploratory analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **predictive modeling** in the next stages of the project."
