# ☀️ Forecasting Solar Irradiance at Al Shuaibah 2 using State-of-the-Art Time Series Models

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)** — the key input for solar energy generation — using **classical time series models** and **state-of-the-art deep learning techniques** trained on **satellite-derived weather data** from NASA’s POWER dataset.

I specifically target the coordinates:

> 📍 **20.7966°N, 39.5785°E**

This is the **future site of the Al Shuaibah 2 Solar Farm**, which is set to become **the largest single-site solar farm in the world** and a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s clean energy transition.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

- 📥 Collect historical **hourly GHI and meteorological data** from NASA POWER for the Al Shuaibah 2 site
- 🔍 Analyze seasonal and diurnal solar radiation trends in Saudi Arabia’s western desert climate
- 🤖 Train machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM, Transformers) to **predict future GHI** from Hugging Face
- 📈 Evaluate model accuracy using RMSE and MAE

## 🇸🇦 Why This Matters for Saudi Vision 2030

Saudi Arabia is undergoing a transformative shift toward **renewable energy**, targeting **50% clean energy generation by 2030**. Solar power, in particular, plays a critical role in mega-projects like:
- **Al Shuaibah 2**
- **NEOM**
- **Sudair Solar PV Plant**
- **Sakaka Solar Power Project**

Accurate forecasting of solar irradiance is essential for:
- **Grid stability and energy storage planning**
- **Efficient operation of solar farms**
- **Smart city infrastructure** and dynamic pricing
- **Localized AI innovation**, a Vision 2030 strategic pillar

This project contributes by:

- 📊 Providing a prototype for **solar output forecasting**, vital for grid stability and energy planning
- 🛠 Demonstrating how **machine learning can optimize solar farm operations**
- 🌍 Applying **open-access global satellite data** in a local, strategic context
- 🤝 Bridging **data science and sustainability** — two pillars of Saudi Arabia’s tech and energy future
